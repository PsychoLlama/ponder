# Ponder
_A notes app for programmers_

---

## Project Status
:warning: Experimental

I have a habit of creating and immediately abandoning side projects. Time will
tell if this one sticks.

## Mission
Provide a feature-rich notes app that syncs peer-to-peer between all your devices.

This project is managed by
[freighter](https://github.com/PsychoLlama/freighter) and is a potential
testbed for the [mytosis](https://github.com/PsychoLlama/mytosis) P2P
framework.

## Personal Goals
These features have to be implemented before Ponder can feasibly replace my
current notes app (Boostnote):
- [x] Ability to create notes
- [x] Ability to rename notes
- [ ] Ability to delete notes
- [x] Rich text editing
- [ ] Fuzzy search by note title
- [ ] Syntax-highlighted code snippets
- [ ] Pre-built app distributions

## Inspirations
These other apps have inspired part of the design.

- [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/) (mac-only, proprietary, paid)
- [Apple Notes](https://www.icloud.com/#notes) (vendor lock-in, proprietary)
- [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) (cross-platform, FOSS)

More recently, I've discovered [notion](https://www.notion.so/). It's caused
me to rethink Ponder's design. None of those changes have made it into code
yet.
